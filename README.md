## Concept

This app is designed to be a new way to interact with twitch and your favorite
streamers!  It's built sort of like Fantasy Football, you get a group of
friends, form a league, and draft your team.  Each week stats like views,
followers, subs, and time streamed will be calculated to get you points.  At
the end of the week the user with the most points in the head to head matchup
will take a win.  The user with the best record at the end of the season will
win their league.
